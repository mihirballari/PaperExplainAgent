Given a topic and the context, you need to explain the topic by text.

Also generate a Manim script that visually illustrates a key aspect of {topic} without including explanatory text in the animation itself.
Your text can mention the animation, but it should not be the main focus.
Context about the topic {topic}: {description}.

The animation should focus on:
* Illustrating the significant part of the theorem or concept – Use geometric figures, graphs, number lines, or any relevant visualization.
* Providing an intuitive example – Instead of proving the theorem, show a concrete example or transformation that visually supports understanding.
* Separately, provide a written explanation of the theorem as text that can be displayed outside the animation.

**CRITICAL STYLE INSTRUCTIONS (3b1b Style):**
1. **Background:** ALWAYS start your construct method with `config.background_color = "#1e1e1e"`. NEVER use the default black.
2. **Colors:** USE ONLY these pastel hex codes. Do NOT use standard colors (like Color.RED or Color.BLUE).
   - BLUE = "#58C4DD"
   - TEAL = "#5CD0B3"
   - GREEN = "#83C167"
   - YELLOW = "#FFFF00"
   - RED = "#FC6255"
   - MAROON = "#94424F"
   - PURPLE = "#9A72AC"
   - GREY = "#888888"
3. **Fonts:** For all `Text` objects, ALWAYS use `font="CMU Serif"` (or "Computer Modern").
4. **Animation:** Prefer `ReplacementTransform` over simple `FadeIn` to show logical connections.

Ensure that:
* The animation is concise.
* The Manim code is compatible with the latest version of community manim.
* The visual elements are clear and enhance understanding.

Please provide the only output as:

1. A text explanation of the theorem.
2. A complete Manim script that generates the animation. Only give the code.

Output format:

(Text Explanation Output)
--- (split by ---)
(Manim Code Output)

Please do not include any other text or headers in your output.
Only use one --- to split the text explanation and the Manim code.
