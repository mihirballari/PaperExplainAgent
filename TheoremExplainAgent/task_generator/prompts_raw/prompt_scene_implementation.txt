**Core Philosophy to Apply:**
1.  **Intuition First:** Visuals should not just display math; they should explain *why* it works geometrically or logically.
2.  **Morphing over Fading:** Usage of `ReplacementTransform` is preferred over simple `FadeIn`. Show how one concept physically transforms into another.
3.  **Color Meaning:** Use color to link algebraic variables to geometric components (e.g., if $x$ is YELLOW in the equation, the line segment representing $x$ must be YELLOW).
4.  **Clean & Minimalist:** Dark background (default), sans-serif text for narration, LaTeX for math.

<IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN>

[SCENE_VISION]
1.  **Overall Narrative**:
    - Describe the overall story or message of the scene. What is the key takeaway for the viewer?
    - How does this scene fit into the larger narrative of the video?
    - **The "Aha!" Moment:** What is the specific moment where the abstract concept becomes intuitive?
    - What is the desired emotional impact? (e.g., Curiosity, Surprise, Satisfaction).

2.  **Learning Objectives**:
    - What specific knowledge or skills should the viewer gain from this scene?
    - How will the visual elements and animations support these learning objectives?
    - **Intuitive Mapping:** How do the visuals create a direct mapping between the math and the intuition?

[STORYBOARD]
1.  **Visual Flow**:
    - Describe the sequence of visual elements and animations in the scene.
    - Provide a description of the key visual moments.
    - **Transition Logic:** How will the scene transition between different ideas? (Focus on morphing and transforming rather than clearing the screen).
    - What is the pacing? (e.g., "Slow and deliberate during the derivation, snappy during the summary").

[TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION]
1.  **High-Level Components (VGroups)**:
    - **Identify the main conceptual sections of the scene.** (e.g., "EquationGroup", "GeometricGraphGroup").
    - **Define the purpose of each high-level component.**
    - **Describe how these components relate to each other.**
    - **Provide a brief rationale.** (e.g., "Separating the algebra on the left to contrast with the geometry on the right").

2.  **VGroup Hierarchy**:
    - **For each high-level component, define a parent VGroup.**
    - **Break down each parent VGroup into nested VGroups for sub-components.**
    - **Specify the relative positioning of these VGroups.**
        - Use `next_to()`, `align_to()`, and `shift()` relative to `ORIGIN`, scene margins, or other VGroups.
        - **MUST NOT use absolute coordinates.**
    - **Define scale relationships.**
    - **Provide a brief rationale.**

    For each VGroup level:
    - Name: [Descriptive name, e.g., "TheoremStatement"]
    - Purpose: [What is the visual role of this group?]
    - Contents: [List child VGroups and individual elements]
    - Positioning:
        * Reference: [Relative to what?]
        * Alignment: [e.g., `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`]
        * Spacing: [Buffer distance]
    - Scale: [Relative scale]
    - Rationale: [Why is this grouped this way?]

3.  **Element Specification**:
    For each individual element (Text, MathTex, Shapes, etc.):
    - Name: [Descriptive name, e.g., "VariableX", "HighlightCircle"]
    - Type: [Manim object type. Use `MathTex` for all math/variables, `Text` for narrative words.]
    - Parent VGroup: [Container VGroup]
    - Positioning:
        * Reference: [Relative reference]
        * Alignment: [Alignment direction]
        * Spacing: [Buffer]
    - Style Properties (**3B1B Standards**):
        * Color: [Use Manim standard colors: **BLUE** (primary structure), **YELLOW** (focus variable), **TEAL**, **RED** (counter-example/error), **WHITE** (standard text). Avoid random RGB.]
        * Opacity: [1.0 for active, 0.2-0.5 for inactive/background context.]
        * Stroke Width: [Standard is 2-4. Bold/Highlight is 6-8.]
        * Font: [Use default LaTeX font for MathTex. Use Sans-serif for Text.]
        * Font Size: [Ensure readability on mobile screens.]
    - Z-Index: [Equations/Text usually sit above Shapes.]
    - Required Imports: [e.g., `from manim import *`]

[ANIMATION_STRATEGY]
1.  **VGroup Transitions**:
    - **Define how parent VGroups will transition onto/off the scene.**
    - **Prioritize Logic:** Use `ReplacementTransform` to show how one group *becomes* another. Avoid simple `FadeIn` unless introducing a completely new, unrelated concept.
    - **Timing:** How long will each transition take?

2.  **Element Animations**:
    - **Define animations for individual elements.**
    - **Writing:** Use `Write` or `Create` for text and lines to mimic drawing/writing.
    - **Focus:** Use `Indicate`, `Flash`, or `Circumscribe` (in YELLOW) to draw attention to specific parts of an equation or shape during narration.
    - **Grouping:** Use `AnimationGroup` or `Succession` for complex sequences.
    - **Coordinate element animations with parent VGroup movements.**

3.  **Scene Flow**:
    - **Describe the overall animation sequence.**
    - **Waits:** Specify transition buffers (`wait(1)`) to let the viewer process complex information.
    - **Sync:** How will the animation timing coordinate with the narration?

[NARRATION]
- **Narration Script:** [Provide the full script. Tone should be **conversational, enthusiastic, and approachable**—like a friend explaining a discovery, not a formal lecture.]
- **Narration Sync:** [Describe exactly which words trigger which animations. e.g., "Start drawing the circle exactly when I say 'consider a boundary...'"]

[VIEWER_EXPERIENCE]
1.  **Cognitive Load**:
    - How will you manage the amount of information? (e.g., "Fade out the previous equation so the viewer focuses on the new derivation").
    - **Color Association:** How will you use color consistency to lower cognitive load?

2.  **Pacing**:
    - Is the pacing appropriate? Are there moments of pause and reflect?
    - How will you use animation timing to control the pace?

3.  **Accessibility**:
    - How will you ensure high contrast and readability?

[TECHNICAL_CHECKS]
- **VGroup boundary validation:** Ensure all elements are contained within boundaries.
- **Hierarchy scale consistency:** Verify scaling is consistent.
- **Animation coordination:** Check that animations don't clash.
- **Color Consistency:** Verify that variables (e.g., $x$) retain the same color (e.g., YELLOW) across both Equations and Geometry.
- **Text readability:** Ensure all text is legible.
- **Relative Positioning:** **CRITICAL:** Confirm no absolute coordinates are used.

</IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN>

Requirements:
1. All elements must stay within safe area margins.
2. Maintain minimum spacing between objects: [value]
3. Use relative positioning when possible, leveraging `next_to()`, `align_to()`, and `shift()`. Only reference positions relative to `ORIGIN`, scene margins, or other object reference points. **Do not use absolute coordinates.**
4. Include transition buffers (`wait()`) between animations.
5. Specify z-index for overlapping elements (Text over Geometry).
6. **Use Manim Standard Colors** (BLUE, TEAL, YELLOW, RED, WHITE, GREY).
7. Define scale relative to base unit.
8. No external dependencies.
9. Currently, there are no images or other assets available locally or remotely. Only include elements that can be generated through manim.
10. **Do not generate any code in this plan, except for illustrative examples where necessary. This plan is for outlining the scene and should not include any python code.**
11. **The purpose of this plan is to be a detailed guide for a human to implement the scene in manim, adhering to the 3Blue1Brown visual style.**
