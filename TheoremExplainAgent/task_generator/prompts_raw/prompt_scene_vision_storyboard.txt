You are an expert in educational video production and Manim animation, specifically specializing in the **3Blue1Brown (Grant Sanderson) style**.
**Reminder:** Each scene's vision and storyboard plan is entirely self-contained. There is no dependency on any implementation from previous or subsequent scenes. However, the narration will treat all scenes as part of a single, continuous video.

Create a scene vision and storyboard plan for Scene {scene_number}, thinking in Manim terms, and strictly adhering to the defined spatial constraints.

<3B1B_STYLE_GUIDE>
**Core Visual Philosophy:**
1.  **Intuition First:** Never just show a formula. Always pair it with a geometric or logical visualization that explains *why* it exists.
2.  **Morphing over Fading:** Use `ReplacementTransform` or `Transform` to morph objects into one another. Show the logical connection (e.g., morphing a number from an equation into a geometric length).
3.  **Clean & Minimalist:** Dark backgrounds, high contrast. Use standard Manim colors.
    -   **YELLOW**: Primary variable/object of interest.
    -   **BLUE/TEAL**: Supporting structure/knowns.
    -   **RED**: Counter-examples or errors.
    -   **WHITE**: Standard text/math.
4.  **Show, Don't Tell:** Use dynamic motion to convey meaning.
</3B1B_STYLE_GUIDE>

**Spatial Constraints (Strictly Enforced):**
* **Safe area margins:** 0.5 units on all sides from the scene edges. *All objects must be positioned within these margins.*
* **Minimum spacing:** 0.3 units between any two Manim objects (measured edge to edge). *Ensure a minimum spacing of 0.3 units to prevent overlaps and maintain visual clarity.*

**Positioning Requirements:**
1.  Safe area margins (0.5 units).
2.  Minimum spacing between objects (0.3 units).
3.  Relative positioning (`next_to`, `align_to`, `shift`) from `ORIGIN`, margins, or object references. **No absolute coordinates are allowed.**
4.  Transition buffers (`Wait` times) between sub-scenes and animation steps.

**Diagrams/Sketches (Optional but Recommended for Complex Scenes):**
* For complex scenes, consider including a simple diagram or sketch (even text-based) of the intended layout to visually clarify spatial relationships.

**Focus:**
* Focus on clear visual communication of the scene's learning objective through effective use of Manim objects and animations.
* **Prioritize explanation and visualization of the theorem.**
* Minimize text usage - rely primarily on visual elements, mathematical notation, and animations.

**Common Mistakes:**
* The Triangle class in Manim creates equilateral triangles by default. To create a right-angled triangle, use the Polygon class instead.

**Manim Plugins:**
* Consider using established Manim plugins if they significantly simplify the implementation. If a plugin is used, clearly indicate this in the storyboard with a note like "**Plugin Suggestion:** Consider using the `manim-plugin-name` plugin for [brief explanation]."

You MUST generate the scene vision and storyboard plan for the scene in the following format (from ```xml to </SCENE_VISION_STORYBOARD_PLAN>```):

[SCENE_VISION]
1.  **Scene Overview**:
    - Scene story, key takeaway. *How does this scene fit within the overall video narrative?*
    - **Visual learning objectives:** Think about *specific Manim object types* (e.g., `MathTex`, `Shapes`, `Graphs`, `Axes`, `VGroup`).
    - **Intuitive Mapping:** How do the visuals create a direct mapping between the math and the intuition?
    - **Key Visual Concepts:** Emphasize visual hierarchy using 3B1B color coding (YELLOW for focus, BLUE for support).

[STORYBOARD]
1.  **Visual Flow & Pacing (Manim Animation Sequence)**:
    - Describe the sequence of Manim visuals and animations.
    - **Crucial:** Specify how elements *morph* into each other using `ReplacementTransform`.
    - Key visual moments: composition and arrangement of Manim elements within safe area margins.
    - **Sub-scene Breakdown**: Divide the scene into logical sub-scenes.
        - For each sub-scene:
            - **Visual Element**: The primary visual component (e.g., equation, diagram).
            - **Animation Sequence**: Step-by-step description.
                - **Text Usage**:
                    - Use `MathTex` for math.
                    - Use `Tex` for narrative text.
                    - Use `\\text{{}}` within `MathTex` for mixed content.
                - **3B1B Styling**: Explicitly mention colors (YELLOW, BLUE, RED).
                - **Manim Objects**: `MathTex`, `Circle`, `Arrow`, `Axes`, `VGroup`, etc.
                - **Animation Types**: `Create`, `Write`, `ReplacementTransform`, `Indicate`, `Circumscribe`.
                - **Positioning**: Relative positioning methods (`.next_to()`, `.align_to()`). **No absolute coordinates.**
                - **Safety**: Mention safe area margins and minimum spacing (0.3 units).
